## How Flex Works

## Properties For Parent (flex-container)

#### display
```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

#### flex-direction
Check out the above architecture image to get more clarity.
```css
.container {
  flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column column-reverse;
}
```

#### flex-wrap
By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
```css
.container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;
}
```

#### flex-flow
This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
```css
.container {
  flex-flow: column nowrap;
}
```

#### justify-content
```css
.container {
  justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
}
```

#### align-items
You can override the align-items behavior for individual flex items by applying the align-self property to the particular item.
```css
.container {
  align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center;
}
```

#### align-content
```css
.container {
  align-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch;
}
```

## Properties For Children (flex-items)

#### order
The order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. Flex items with higher order values set on them will appear later in the display order than items with lower order values.
```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```

#### flex-grow
This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.
```css
.item {
  flex-grow: 4; /* default 0 */
}
```

#### flex-shrink
This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
```css
.item {
  flex-shrink: 3; /* default 1 */
}
```

#### align-self
This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
```css
.item {
  align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
}
```

float, clear and vertical-align have no effect on a flex item.
